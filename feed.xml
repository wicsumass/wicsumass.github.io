            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, WiCS organized and led a group of undergraduates (along with a few graduate students) joined more than 500 other engineers at Harvard for WECode 2018, a women in CS conference that aims to promote diversity. We had the pleasure of listening to captivating speakers, mingle with other women and men passionate about diversity, and learn a whole lot in the process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WiCS is proud to provide travel and ticket reimbursement to undergraduates attending the event - if you attended the event but didn’t let us know/haven’t been reimbursed yet, reach out to one of the co-chairs! Check out some photos we took at WECode below:&lt;/p&gt;
